    "description": "<paragraph>I'm a curious individual that loves to learn about how things work and languages. I'm specially passionate in trying to understand people's point of view and how their differences - be it cultural, geographical or others - impact on each individual's thoughts, feelings and how that affect how they interact with things. More often than not, you might find me tinkering with some old piece of tech that probably doesn't work anymore, but at least I'll try to understand how it used to work or give it a new meaning.</paragraph><paragraph>I've already studied a couple of languages, but I haven't had much time to practice or put them in use, but in general, I like learning new languages because it helps understand another's culture, history and even their thought process. Some of those languages: korean, french, spanish, chinese.</paragraph>",

      "projectOverview": "<paragraph>The MDGeo have an ongoing and exclusive contract with Petrobras on the development of a software suite, which includes a Restoration and Simulation of Geological Models and a Geomechanical Analysis systems.</paragraph><paragraph>The system consists of an attempt to reconstitute the original geometry of the model’s layers, before the occurrence of  deformation throughout time. Due to the lack of information on the deformation mechanisms that took place in the past, different restoration techniques are based on geological premises that can be simulated in different ways.</paragraph><paragraph>The application of geological models restoration techniques aims to validate wells and seismic data interpretation, provide a better understanding of the geohistory and obtain results in terms of these models’ deformation measurements concentration.</paragraph><paragraph>This information helps in the identification of oil systems and, thus, the establishment of attractive regions for prospecting. It also helps reducing exploration risks.</paragraph>",
      "contributions": "<paragraph>My main responsibilities in the team was being part of the solutions creating sessions for new tools and/or adjustments on previous features; create low fidelity screens; build high fidelity prototypes for usability testing; handing-in deliverables to developers; follow-ups with developers after the tool has been launched.</paragraph><paragraph>Besides that, some of the greatest challenges I would had to face some now and then was coming up with a graphical representation of a specific geological term, in which I would rely on long talks with the geologists and some extensive research.</paragraph>"

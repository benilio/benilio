					<h4>Project Overview</h4>
					<p>
						IHGBI (Instituto Hist칩rico e Geogr치fico da Baixada de Iraj치) is a
						collective whose focus is to value the history, identity, memory and
						heritage of the Iraj치 neighborhood.
					</p>
					<p>
						As part of the collective's activities, besides participating in
						local events and promoting talks and diverse multimedia projects,
						the members have been publishing an online version of a journal with
						the many articles written by the members and collaborators.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>My Contributions</h4>
					<p>
						Alongside Nelson Carvalho, we worked from the bottom-up to structure
						and design what would be the IHGBI's new web page, which would
						include all information about the collective's projects and access
						to their works in one platform.
					</p>
					<p>
						From the structural diagram to the making of the wireframes,
						prototype and final product, both of us worked in unison to apply
						the newest Visual Identity of the collective in a new product that
						would be able to portray the group's essence and meaning, while
						centralizing everything in one place.
